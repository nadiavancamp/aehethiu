I want to build a list of reasons not to vote for the Conservatives this election. This will be beneficial for ABC voters trying to convince family, friends, or anyone else. Here's what I've put together so far. Scandals: Harper involved in helping shield files of multimillionaires with offshore accounts from CRA.

Each Comment should: (i) contain an abstract and clearly state the paper to which it refers. The Obama administration, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and others, essentially funded and supported elements of al Qaeda to take down President Muammar Gaddafi and overthrow the Libyan government. Libya spiraled into chaos and a safe haven for terrorist groups like ISIS to blossom. Gadafi's weapons stockpile were seized, and then shipped to the ports near Turkey, which was then distributed to "rebel" fighters in Syria. These rebel fighters, operating under the umbrella of the "Free Syrian.
