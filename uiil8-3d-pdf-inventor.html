Inventor allows 2D and 3D data integration in a single environment, creating a virtual representation of the final product that enables users to validate the form, fit, and function of the product before it is ever built. In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an “Intergalactic Computer Network.” Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving

So, in any discussion about Apple's 3D sensing module involving STM, Intel with its RealSense technology must come up. Officially a competitor (MVIS filings), clearly a frenemy (see fawning MVIS article re. Interactive picoprojection using Intel Joule) and hopefully a partner, if STM is using MEMS mirrors, as is likely, in Apple's 3D sensor, does that implicate Intel, MVIS or both, given that STM already makes MEMS mirrors for both Intel and MVIS and both Intel and MVIS have IP in 3D sensing?. 2 Autodesk® Inventor® - это семейство продуктов для машиностроительного и промышленного 3D-проектирования, включающее в себя средства. 
Hi, I am only 14 but have gotten into Fusion 360 and Autodesk Inventor, I 3D print most of my designs so I use calipers a lot. Up till now I,ve been using a  pair of cheap calipers that just broke. My grandpa being a machinist said he would buy me a “proper” Mitutoyo caliper set. I have been looking at them and I’m confused I know I don’t need a super pricy coolant resistant pair I just want a 6” 150mm set with the position hold thing. I think it’s called AOS?

I scanned an old isometric template that I had into a PDF format. I tried importing that into AutoCAD 2017 but it wouldn't let me import it.

Flexible: The 3D PDF file is customizable, versatile and easy-to-use. 3D PDF is ideal for: • Multimedia and interactive catalogues and brochures • Technical documents such as product sheets, technical information leaflets etc.  Solid Edge ®, Inventor. I just upgraded my autodesk product design suite to 2017 and Inventor now has the capability to create 3d pdfs from the models (natively without a plugin). Well this is a cool feature, and I'd like to use it as an aid for fabrication, and our field people use iPads and Android tablets. However every app I have tried on both type of the devices, the 3d pdf fails to load. Does anyone have any insight on how to make this work, or have any of their own success doing something like this.
